# 3 ways to find out the TYPE of data
dumbo <- 173
class(dumbo)
str(dumbo)


# make a list variable of integers

data <- c(2,6,3,7,4,8,6,3,5,1,3,4,9,8,5,7,5,8)



# find the mean and standard deviation of the list




# what data type will this list be if you change ONE value to a character with "quotes"?

data <- c(2,6,3,7,4,8,6,"3",5,1,3,4,9,8,5,7,5,8)
class(data)


# make a list of 30 zeros



# make a sequence of numbers from 3.4 to 9.6 in increments of 0.1



# store it as a variable



# find the length of variable



# Recall and use at least one descriptive statistics command





# the DEVIANCE is the difference between a datapoint and the MEAN of that dataset.
# FIND the deviance of your data "by hand"

data - mean(data)



# make a scatter plot of your data




# make histogram
